# PasswordGenerator
This is a simple python program that generates passwords.
## Working of this GUI
* The entry fields asking for inputs take only integers and also they are not optimized for taking other data types,
so typing anything other than integers will break the software.
* Also pls don't enter the value of numbers and special characters needed in the software gives a sum more than the actual length of the
password you need. All this bugs will be changed sooner.
* Once you click Enter after you input your values. The password will be copied to the clipboard automatically.


**Pls install pyperclip before importing this file, without it, this software will crash**
